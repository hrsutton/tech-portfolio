I moved to Dallas in 2016 to follow my dream to work in cyber security. In the last few years I have discovered that my passion is working in security but also cyber security awareness to make sure every developer can practice security down to the code level. I feel it is important to spread the awareness of DevSecOps in edition to DevOps. Both are essential for application maintainability but DevSecOps is crucial to maintain customer trust and reputation. Security is a mindset and not just a hobby.
